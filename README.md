# JIRA Capex Report
Create a capex report based on your Atlassian JIRA issues

Just specify your login credentials and the JQL query for the JIRAs that you would like to analyse and of you go!
Then all JIRAs are analysed, including sub-tasks, for logged hours during the time period that you've specified.
